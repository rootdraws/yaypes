YAYPEs is a derivative project of [Yaypegs](https://yaypegs.com/), released on Base. After one month of trading, the project has only done 11 ETH in volume. The [offers](https://opensea.io/collection/yaypes/offers) at the time of writing a sale of 600 YAYPEs would bring the floor down to below .0001 ETH per YAYPE. The artist, [ccmoret](https://x.com/ccmoret), has invested creative energy into the artwork for the project, and the current trade volume of YAYPEs does not reflect this artistic effort.

## Thesis: 7 Ways to Increase the Value of YAYPEs

1. Launch Token Gated Discord, so YAYPEs can socialize.
2. Airdrop 1 $YAY to YAYPE Holders, for distribution.
3. Burn 1 YAYPE for 1 $YAY to correct supply overhang.
4. Form a DAO using PartyDAO to manage LP - entry costs .1 ETH.
5. Create DAO Owned $YAY/ETH LP on Univ2.
6. Create DAO Owned Pool on Sudoswap.
7. Launch YAY-ETH Univ2 LP Farm to bootstrap liquiidty.

Grassroots YAYPES aims to launch these strategies, to test their impact on the project.

## $YAY Tokenomics

The YAYPEs NFT Collection has a total supply of 10,000 NFTs. There are currently 2753 holders of these NFTs.
